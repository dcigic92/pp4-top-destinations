## Agile Development Process
GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects served as an Agile tool for this project. It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dcigic92/pp4-top-destinations.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate migrations:**

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py makemigrrations
   ```

4. **Apply migrations:**

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser:**

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create an admin account.

6. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

   The project should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Deployment

### Heroku:

1. **Create Heroku App:**
   - Create a new Heroku app and link it to the Git repository for the project.

2. **Heroku Configurations:**
   - In Heroku's settings set up config vars such as the Database URL, Cloudinary URL and the Secret Key.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the project to Heroku by pushing the code to the Heroku remote repository, set Debug=False before final deployment.
